Folder: Person Image Classification Problem -

Given a 256x256 image, write a binary classifier to differentiate the given image has a human or not.
The approach and the code are more important than the accuracy rate. Please feel free to pick a relevant
 open dataset for this problem. Upload the code and test images to GitHub and share the link.
 Write a README on your approach

Folder: Finding Dominant Color Hexcode

Given an image, identify the dominant colors (hex code) eliminating the neutral colors (white, black and greys)
using OpenCV. Upload the code and test images to GitHub and share the link. Write a README on your approach


Note:

P.S.: I am new to OpenCV, I have gone through lot of online blogs to come up with the solution. I wasn't able
to eliminate neutral colors for second problem. I am currently going through Final exams(will get completed on april 12)
and have an exam tomorrow. That's why I am mailing the solution before hand.
